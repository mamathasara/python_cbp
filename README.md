# Employee Productivity Prediction
In this project, I will be working as a Product Data Scientist in a germent manufacturing company using Tree models to predict the productivity of their employees.
The garment industry is one of the key examples of industrial globalization in this modern era. It is a highly labor-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfaction of huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent upon the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. Therefore, the tracking, analyses, and predictions of productivity performances of the working teams in factories are extremely desirable for the decision makers in the garment industry. 
# About the Dataset
The link to the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/597/productivity+prediction+of+garment+employees). The data contain over 1000 observations with 15 features.
## Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-Learn**: for implementing tree models and evaluating performance
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn**: for visualizations 
- **NumPy**: for numerical operations
- **OneHotEnCoder**: for data preprocessing
- **DecisionTreeClassifier**: To build the model
# Evaluation
The model has; 
+ **Acurracy**: 85%
+ **Precission Score**: 87%
+ **Recall Score**: 94%
+ **F1 Score**: 90%
  
**Random Forest** was used to confirm and validate the results from the Decision Tree Model.
